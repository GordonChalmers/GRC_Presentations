GRC_Presentations 

This directory contains my PowerPoint presentations given while I was at 

- the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) at the University of Georgia 
(UGA) working in the Prestegard and Woods groups 

- the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS) at Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

The topic descriptions are in the name of the files.

My CS Ph.D. dissertation is also in this directory.

These presentations are not the complete set.  Neither is there a complete set 
of projects that I worked on and with others, including graduate students.
